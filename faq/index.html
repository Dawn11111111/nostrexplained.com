<h1>Nostr FAQ</h1>

<h2>Is Nostr a Bitcoin thing?</h2>
<p>
  No. Nostr has no relationship to Bitcoin, does not depend on Bitcoin and no
  one has to have ever heard the word "Bitcoin" uttered to them in order to use
  Nostr.
</p>

<h2>
  How can I see my friend posts if I post on a specific relays and my friend on
  others?
</h2>
<p>
  Different approaches can be used, but the most common one is that your client
  will automatically announce the relays you generally publish to, and your
  friend's client will automatically connect to these relays specifically to
  fetch your posts (and connect to other relays to fetch other people's posts).
</p>

<h2>
  How can Nostr deal with horrible people without moderation (or some form of
  good censorship)?
</h2>
<p>
  It is not true that Nostr doesn't have moderation or censorship. Nostr just
  doesn't have a central committee of censors, but each relay is privately owned
  and can censor anyone they want. As the network grow it will become more
  common for relays to have some form of sign-up process so not everyone can
  publish a million offensive notes to every relay using throwaway identities
  and get away with it.
</p>
<p>
  But even in a world in which relays don't do any of that clients can still
  protect users from harassment by fetching <em>only what they want</em> from
  relays and filtering out garbage locally -- in fact many clients already do
  this using various heuristics.
</p>

<h2>
  How can Nostr stay decentralized if the amount of content relays have to store
  keep getting bigger and so relays get increasingly costlier to run?
</h2>
<p>
  This is not what happens. Relays do not have to store everything and are never
  expected to store everything. Relays can store posts only from people they
  want, and only for the time they want (they can delete things). A relay
  database can be as small as few kilobytes just for your personal notes.
